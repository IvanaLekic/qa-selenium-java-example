# TD15_partial_2- FTN Informatika

This project contains Selenium test scenario implemented using Java, TestNG and Page Object Model.
The application under test was a locally deployed student service system used during training, so the tests cannot be executed without that environment.
The repository demonstrates test structure, page objects organization and testing approach.
The original exam task description (in Serbian) is included in the Tests_description folder for reference.
